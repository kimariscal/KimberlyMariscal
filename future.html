  <h3>why I want to become a teacher?</h3>
  <p>I want to become a teacher because I want to help students learn and grow. I want to make a positive impact on their lives and help them reach their full potential. I also want to create a safe and supportive learning environment where students feel valued and respected. Teaching is a rewarding profession that allows me to make a difference in the lives of young learners.I want to see my student in the future being a doctor, nurse, police officer, teachers and so on.</p>
